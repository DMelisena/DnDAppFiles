# DnDAppFiles - Renewed


## My Uses and what you can use it for

I've forked this thread for my own application needs such as building custom pages in OneNote or quickly adding every Spell and Monster to Trell.  These Files have unlimited uses. I'm unsure why they aren't more popularly used, they can go beyond importing in to the GM5 and FIgh Club apps.
